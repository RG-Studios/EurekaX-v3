# 🚀 EurekaX v3 – Autonomous Cross-Domain Discovery Engine (TF-IDF Edition)

EurekaX v3 is a modular and scalable AI system that autonomously generates scientific hypotheses by combining insights across multiple domains like **AI**, **Aerospace**, **Neuroscience**, and **Quantum Computing**.

It uses semantic reasoning via **TF-IDF embeddings**, scores novelty and feasibility, and stores only the most promising or breakthrough ideas into a structured JSON memory.

## 🧠 What It Does

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧩 Cross-domain pairing | Selects two random fields and builds hypotheses |
| 🔍 Novelty scoring | Uses TF-IDF + cosine similarity |
| 🔬 Feasibility scoring | Simulates feasibility based on keyword overlap |
| 📊 Insight scoring | Final score = 60% novelty + 40% feasibility |
| 🏆 Verdict classification | Classifies as `Breakthrough`, `Promising`, `Uncertain`, or `Rejected` |
| 💾 Persistent memory | Logs all accepted insights into `eurekax_insights.json` |
